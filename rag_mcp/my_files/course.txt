- broader category: finance (splitem)
- background: the app is already built as part of HCDD 340 (mobile computing)
- deliverable: a smartphone app
-- Receipt scannaer
-- Each person can choose what they ordered
-- Bill splitter
-- React native (web, mongodb)


## Potential contributions: 
- there are similar apps (e.g., Zelle, Splitwise <https://www.splitwise.com>);
- taking the app in real world; 
- seeking feedback from real users, and improve it based on their feedback
- deploy it through Test Flight app;
- use an existing app (e.g., Splitwise as the baseline);

- many are socially isolated, have issues with communication, need special incentives (e.g., credits, points, prestige points)
- the coder community has more males than females (3:1) 
- making a safe, welcoming environment is a solid contribution

- Redesigned stack-overflow (information overload)
- ChatGPT: data privacy,
- number of questions (tabs, customized)
- a survey with programmers
- Figma + AI mockup
